 ## Steps to train model:
 1. Setup: (same as step 1 for "Steps to run app"
 2. Download [Facial expression recognition (FER 2013) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset) and save as folder called "images"
 3. Run all cells in create_model.ipynb file to train the model
